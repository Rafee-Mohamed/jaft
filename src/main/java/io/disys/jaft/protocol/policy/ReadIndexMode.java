 * <h4>Heartbeat modes vs Lease</h4>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Heartbeat modes</strong> confirm leadership by getting a
 *       majority ack on the network - safe under asynchronous assumptions
 *       (no clock dependency).</li>
 *   <li><strong>Lease mode</strong> assumes bounded clock drift and skips
 *       the network round-trip, serving reads immediately if the leader
 *       believes its lease is still valid.</li>
