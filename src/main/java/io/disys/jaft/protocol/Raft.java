     *
     * <ol>
     *   <li><b>Quorum check (election timeout interval):</b> Verifies that
     *       a majority of peers have responded recently. If quorum is lost,
     *       the leader steps down to Follower to avoid a "zombie leader"
     *       that is partitioned from the cluster. After a quorum check, any
     *       in-progress leadership transfer is aborted  - if the transfer
     *       hasn't completed within an election timeout, the transferee is
     *       likely unreachable.</li>
     *   <li><b>Heartbeat (heartbeat timeout interval):</b> Broadcasts
     *       heartbeats to all peers to maintain leader authority and prevent
     *       followers from starting elections. Only fires if the node is
     *       still a leader (the quorum check above may have caused a
     *       step-down).</li>
     * </ol>
     *
     * <p>Both timers are dispatched through {@code step()} as internal
     * messages ({@link Message.CheckQuorum},
     * {@link Message.TriggerHeartbeat}) to reuse the standard message
     * handling pipeline.</p>
     *
     * <h4>Future improvement 1: Soft Quorum + Vote Rejection for Lease Reads</h4>
     *
     * <p>Currently, checkQuorum does three things at once:</p>
     * <ol>
     *   <li>Leader steps down if it loses majority contact (partition
     *       detection)</li>
     *   <li>Followers reject votes from higher-term nodes if a leader was
     *       recently heard from (prevents disruptive elections from
     *       partitioned nodes)</li>
     *   <li>Together (1) + (2) form the implicit lease window for
     *       lease-based reads</li>
     * </ol>
     *
     * <p>The step-down in (1) is aggressive: a brief network hiccup causes
     * the leader to abdicate even though it may still be the rightful
     * leader. For lease reads, all we actually need is:</p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li><b>Soft quorum check:</b> the leader tracks whether it has
     *       heard from a majority recently. If not, it stops serving lease
     *       reads but does NOT step down. It can still serve heartbeat-based
     *       reads and accept writes.</li>
     *   <li><b>Vote rejection on followers:</b> followers still reject
     *       RequestVote from higher-term nodes if the leader was recently
     *       heard from. This prevents a partitioned node from forcing an
     *       election, which is what actually invalidates the lease.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>With soft quorum + vote rejection, the lease guarantee is preserved
     * (no other leader can be elected while followers believe the current
     * leader is alive), but the leader doesn't step down unnecessarily.
     * This decouples "lease validity" from "leader liveness", giving better
     * availability.</p>
     *
     * <h4>Future improvement 2: Sliding Window Heartbeat Liveness</h4>
     *
     * <p>The current liveness check uses a fixed-window reset cycle:</p>
     *
     * <pre>
     *   election timeout fires -> collect active flags -> reset all to inactive
     *                          -> next cycle starts
     *
     *   Problem (fixed window boundary):
     *     cycle N                          cycle N+1
     *     |--- HB sent --- HB sent ---|--- HB sent --- HB sent ---|
     *                            ^
     *                      delayed HB response from cycle N-1 arrives
     *                      -> marks peer as active in cycle N
     *                      -> peer counted as alive even though it hasn't
     *                         responded to any HB in this cycle
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>A sliding-window approach using heartbeat seq from
     * {@link ReadIndex} avoids this boundary artifact:</p>
     *
     * <pre>
     *   Instead of boolean active flags, check:
     *     peerAckedSeq[peer] >= currentSeq - N
     *
     *   where N = heartbeat rounds per election timeout (e.g., 10)
     *
     *   A peer is "alive" if it has acked a heartbeat within the last N rounds.
     *   No reset cycle, no boundary artifacts. Each ack is timestamped with its
     *   exact round number.
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p><b>Consideration: AppendEntries responses.</b></p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li>The current boolean active flag is set by ANY response from a
     *       peer  - heartbeat responses, AppendEntries responses, etc.</li>
     *   <li>peerAckedSeq only tracks heartbeat acks, so AppendEntries
     *       responses wouldn't count as liveness signals</li>
     *   <li>If implementing, also update peerAckedSeq on AppendEntries
     *       responses:
     *       {@code peerAckedSeq[peer] = max(peerAckedSeq[peer], currentSeq)},
     *       treating any response as equivalent to acking the latest
     *       round</li>
     *   <li>In practice heartbeats and AppendEntries share the same network
     *       path, so if one gets through the other almost certainly will
     *       too</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Why the current approach is acceptable despite this
     * imprecision:</p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Election timeout is long (e.g., 10 heartbeat intervals), so
     *       many heartbeats are sent per cycle</li>
     *   <li>A single stale response is unlikely to be the only signal  - if
     *       a peer is truly alive, it will respond to current heartbeats
     *       too</li>
     *   <li>The window drift is at most one heartbeat interval, which is
     *       small relative to the election timeout</li>
     *   <li>Not theoretically tight, but practically safe for most
     *       deployments</li>
     * </ul>

     * <h3>The problem: divergent logs after partitions</h3>
     *
     * <p>Under normal conditions (no partitions), the follower's log is a
     * prefix of the leader's. The first rejection reveals where the
     * follower's log ends, and the next probe succeeds  - one round
     * trip.</p>
     *
     * <p>But after network partitions or overloaded systems, logs can
     * diverge significantly. Naively probing entry by entry in decreasing
     * order costs:</p>
     *
     * <pre>
     *   round trips = (length of diverging tail) × (network RTT)
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>which can take hours and cause outages for long divergent
     * tails.</p>
     *
     * <p>To fix this, both the follower and the leader cooperate to skip
     * entire term ranges. The result: at most <b>O(distinct terms)</b>
     * round trips instead of O(divergent entries). The leader-side
     * optimization is applied in this method. For the follower-side
     * counterpart, see
     * {@link #handleAppendEntriesForSameOrHigherTerm}.</p>
     *
     * <h3>Leader-side optimization (applied here)</h3>
     *
     * <p>The follower's rejection includes {@code indexHint} and
     * {@code termHint}  - its best guess for where the logs might match
     * and the term at that position in its log.</p>
     *
     * <p>The leader searches its OWN log backward from
     * {@code indexHint} for the first index where the leader's
     * term &lt;= {@code termHint}.</p>
     *
     * <p><b>Why this works:</b> the follower said "my term at index N
     * is T." Log terms only increase within a log, so every index &lt;= N
     * on the follower has term &lt;= T. Any leader log entry with a term
     * <i>higher</i> than T at an index &lt;= N can never match the follower
     * at that position  - the follower's term there is at most T. Skip
     * all of them.</p>
     *
     * <p><b>Example</b> (follower is shorter with lower terms  - leader
     * has the higher divergent tail):</p>
     *
     * <pre>
     *   idx:      1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12
     *   Leader:   1  3  3  3  5  5  5  7  7   7   7   7
     *   Follower: 1  1  1  2  2  2  2
     *   (common prefix: idx 1 only; divergence: idx 2-12)
     * </pre>
     *
     * <ol>
     *   <li>Leader probes at (idx=12, prevLogTerm=7). Follower doesn't
     *       have idx 12. Follower rejects with indexHint=7, termHint=2
     *       (its last index and the term there).</li>
     *
     *   <li><b>Naive approach</b>  - probe one by one from idx 7
     *       downward:
     *
     * <pre>
     *   idx 7: leader term=5, follower term=2 -> mismatch  (round trip 2)
     *   idx 6: leader term=5, follower term=2 -> mismatch  (round trip 3)
     *   idx 5: leader term=5, follower term=2 -> mismatch  (round trip 4)
     *   idx 4: leader term=3, follower term=2 -> mismatch  (round trip 5)
     *   idx 3: leader term=3, follower term=1 -> mismatch  (round trip 6)
     *   idx 2: leader term=3, follower term=1 -> mismatch  (round trip 7)
     *   idx 1: leader term=1, follower term=1 -> match!    (round trip 8)
     * </pre>
     *
     *       <b>8 round trips total.</b></li>
     *
     *   <li><b>With leader-side optimization</b>  - search leader's log
     *       for term &lt;= 2 starting from indexHint=7:
     *
     * <pre>
     *   findConflictEntryByTerm(termHint=2, indexHint=7):
     *     idx 7: leader term=5 &gt; 2, skip    (term 5 covers idx 5-7)
     *     idx 4: leader term=3 &gt; 2, skip    (term 3 covers idx 2-4)
     *     idx 1: leader term=1 &lt;= 2, found!
     * </pre>
     *
     *       Leader jumps straight to probing idx 1  - match!
     *       <b>2 round trips total</b> (initial probe + final probe).
     *       Walked through <b>3 distinct leader terms</b> (5, 3, 1)
     *       instead of 7 individual entries.</li>
     * </ol>
     *
     * <p><b>Complexity:</b> O(distinct terms in the leader's divergent
     * region between indexHint and the match point). In this example:
     * 3 term boundaries instead of 7 entries  - saving 6 round trips.</p>
     *
     * <p><b>When this optimization alone isn't enough:</b> if the
     * follower's divergent tail has <i>higher</i> terms than the
     * leader's, the leader's {@code findConflictEntryByTerm} immediately
     * finds leader term &lt;= termHint at the current index (since the
     * leader's terms are already low)  - no skipping occurs. It
     * degenerates to near-linear probing. The follower-side optimization
     * in {@link #handleAppendEntriesForSameOrHigherTerm} handles this
     * case by searching the follower's own log to skip its high-term
     * divergent tail.</p>

     * (see {@link #handleFailedAppend(Leader, Message.AppendEntriesResponse, PeerProgress)})
     * works well when the <i>leader's</i> divergent tail has higher terms
     * than the follower's  - it skips entire term ranges in the leader's
     * log. But it breaks down when the situation is reversed: the
     * <i>follower's</i> divergent tail has higher terms than the
     * leader's.</p>
     *
     * <p>This can happen after crash/recovery sequences: a follower was
     * briefly elected leader at a higher term, appended entries, then
     * crashed before committing  - those uncommitted entries remain as a
     * high-term divergent tail. In this scenario, the leader-side
     * optimization provides no benefit because the leader's terms in the
     * divergent region are already low (&lt;= every follower termHint), so
     * its backward search immediately lands at the current index every
     * time  - zero skipping, one index per round trip,
     * O(divergent entries).</p>

     * </ol>
     *
     * <p><b>~10 round trips</b>  - the leader-side optimization provided
     * zero benefit from Round 2 onward because the leader's terms (all 3)
     * are consistently &lt;= the follower's termHints (4, 5, 6, 7). The
     * search always lands at the current index. This is still
     * O(divergent entries)  - 9 divergent entries, ~10 round trips.</p>
     *
     * <h4>The solution: follower-side term-range skipping</h4>
     *
     * <p>The follower can do better than naively returning its last index
     * and term. The key insight: the leader's {@code prevLogTerm} reveals
     * information about the leader's entire log prefix  - since terms
     * only increase within a log, every entry before prevLogIndex in the
     * leader's log has term &lt;= prevLogTerm.</p>
     *
     * <p>So the follower searches backward through its OWN log for the
     * largest index where its term &lt;= prevLogTerm. Any follower entry
     * with a term <i>higher</i> than prevLogTerm can never match the
     * leader at that position (the leader's term there is at most
     * prevLogTerm). Skip them all.</p>

     *
     * <p>This is invoked on every election timeout interval (not
     * heartbeat interval) to detect network partitions where the leader
     * can no longer reach a quorum. Without this check, a partitioned
     * leader would continue to accept proposals indefinitely even though
     * those entries can never be committed.</p>

     *
     * <ol>

     *       leader receives any message from it (heartbeat response,
     *       append response, etc.). The leader itself is always counted
     *       as active.</li>
     *   <li>After collecting, <em>all peer flags are reset to
     *       inactive</em> (the leader's own flag stays active). This
     *       means each peer must respond again before the next quorum
     *       check or it will be counted as inactive.</li>
     *   <li>The collected votes are passed to
     *       {@link MembershipConfig#quorumResult(Function)} which
     *       determines if a majority of voters are active.</li>
     *   <li>If the result is anything other than {@code REACHED} (including
     *       {@code PENDING}, which means not enough active peers to form
     *       a definitive majority), the leader steps down to
     *       Follower.</li>

     *   Votes: {A=true, B=false, C=false, D=false, E=false}

     *   <li>D starts election at term 5. D's log is correct: last entry
     *       (idx=3, t=2).</li>
     *   <li>D sends RequestVote to B. Vote comparison: higher last term
     *       wins, if tied higher index wins.</li>
     *   <li>B sees its last term as 3 (wrong), D's last term is 2  -
     *       rejects D as less up-to-date.</li>
     *   <li>Correct last terms are equal (both 2), equal indexes (both 3)
     *        - B should grant.</li>
     * </ol>
     * <p><b>Result:</b> If B's vote was needed for majority (3 of 5), D's
     * election fails  - availability loss. B's inflated last term makes it
