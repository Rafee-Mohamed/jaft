/**
 * Read-only interface over the persisted Raft log.
 *
 * <p>Implemented by the application to expose persisted log entries,
 * hard state (term, vote), and snapshots. The protocol reads from
 * this interface but never writes to it - write operations (append,
 * compact, apply snapshot) are performed by the application when
 * processing {@link io.disys.jaft.engine.RaftOutput}.</p>
