/**
 * A point-in-time capture of the state machine, used to bring slow
 * peers up to speed without replaying the entire log.
 *
 * <p>When a follower or learner is too far behind - the entries it
 * needs have been compacted from the leader's log - the leader sends
 * an {@link io.disys.jaft.message.Message.InstallSnapshot} instead of
 * {@link io.disys.jaft.message.Message.AppendEntries}. The snapshot
 * replaces the receiver's log up to the snapshot point and provides
 * the state machine data needed to resume from that point.</p>
 *
 * <p>A snapshot also carries the cluster's membership configuration
 * at the time it was taken. This is essential because membership
 * changes are log entries, and those entries may have been compacted
 * away. Without the membership in the snapshot, a node restoring
 * from it would have no way to know who the current voters and
 * learners are.</p>
 *
 * @param term       term of the last entry included in the snapshot
 * @param index      index of the last entry included in the snapshot
 *                   (all log entries at or before this index are
 *                   represented by the snapshot data)
 * @param membership the cluster membership configuration at the time
 *                   the snapshot was taken (voters, learners, joint
 *                   state)
 * @param data       the serialized state machine data
