     * <ul>
     *   <li><b>New node (no existing progress)</b>: a fresh {@link PeerProgress}
     *       is created with {@code nextIndex = lastIndex + 1} (optimistic) and
     *       the appropriate role type. The leader will begin probing it.</li>
     *   <li><b>Existing node, role unchanged</b>: progress is carried over as-is.
     *       Replication state (match/next indices, inflight window) is preserved
     *       so there is no disruption.</li>
     *   <li><b>Existing node, promoted (learner to voter)</b>: the role type is
     *       upgraded. The node now participates in commit and election quorums.</li>
     *   <li><b>Existing node, demoted (voter to learner)</b>: the role type is
     *       downgraded. The node no longer counts toward quorum. Note: during
     *       joint consensus, a node in nextLearners is still a voter in the
     *       outgoing config - demotion only takes effect at leave-joint.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Nodes that were in the old config but are absent from the new config
     * are dropped - they don't appear in the new progress map. This handles
     * removed nodes cleanly.</p>
     *
     * <p>All existing and new peers are marked active, since a config change
     * is evidence of cluster liveness.</p>
