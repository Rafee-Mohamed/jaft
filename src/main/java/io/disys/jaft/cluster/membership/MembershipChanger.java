/**
 * Pure configuration transformer for membership changes.
 *
 * <p>Computes a new {@link MembershipConfig} from an existing config and a set
 * of changes. Does not touch peer progress - that reconciliation is handled
 * separately by the leader after the new config is produced.</p>
 *
 * <p>Supports two protocols:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Simple</b> - single-phase change. At most one voter may differ
 *       between the old and new configs (the symmetric difference constraint).
 *       The result is a non-joint config.</li>
 *   <li><b>Joint consensus</b> - two-phase change. First,
 *       {@link #executeProtocol} produces a joint config where both old
 *       (current) and new (incoming) voter sets coexist. Later,
 *       {@link #leaveJoint()} drops the old set and promotes the new set
 *       as the sole config.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Protocol selection is driven by the {@link MembershipTransition} on the
 * proposed changes:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link MembershipTransition#AUTO} - the changer picks simple if the
 *       voter symmetric difference is at most 1, otherwise joint.</li>
 *   <li>{@link MembershipTransition#JOINT_AUTO} /
 *       {@link MembershipTransition#JOINT_EXPLICIT} - always joint.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This class operates on mutable copies of the config sets, so the original
 * {@link MembershipConfig} is never modified.</p>
