/**
 * Tracks {@link CompletableFuture}s for linearizable read requests,
 * reconciling them against the Raft core's read confirmation and
 * release signals.
 *
 * <h2>Read Lifecycle in Raft</h2>
 * <p>A linearizable read goes through three stages inside the Raft
 * core before the application can safely serve it:</p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Registered</b> - the read request is submitted; the leader
 *       records its current commit index and initiates a heartbeat
 *       round to confirm authority.</li>
 *   <li><b>Confirmed</b> - a heartbeat majority ack proves the leader
 *       is still authoritative. The read enters
 *       {@code readsAwaitingApply} in the Raft core, waiting for the
 *       local applied index to reach the recorded commit index.</li>
 *   <li><b>Released</b> - {@code applied >= commitIndex}. The read
 *       moves from {@code readsAwaitingApply} to {@code readStates}
 *       and is surfaced in the output. The application can now serve
 *       the read.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Two-Queue Model</h2>
 * <p>The tracker maintains two FIFO queues that mirror the Raft
 * core's two-stage progression. A future exists in exactly one
 * location at any time: pending, confirmed, or completed.</p>

 *
 *   readsAwaitingApply: [ RS(10), RS(12) ]     applied = 9

 *                         when applied &gt;= 10   RS(12) released when applied reaches 12
 *
 *   After applied advances to 10:
 *
 *   readsAwaitingApply: [ RS(12) ]             readStates: [ RS(10) ]
 *                                              ------------------------
 *                                              surfaced in output, triggers
 *                                              F1.complete(null) in tracker
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Delta Formula</h2>
 * <p>The tracker does not observe individual read events; it infers
 * how many reads were newly confirmed by comparing queue sizes across
 * consecutive {@link #reconcile} calls:</p>
 * <pre>
 *   newlyConfirmed = currentAwaitingApply - previousAwaitingApply + readStates.size()
 *
 *   Derivation:
 *     Let E = reads that entered readsAwaitingApply (newly confirmed)
 *     Let L = reads that left readsAwaitingApply (released to readStates)
 *
 *     currentSize - previousSize = E - L
 *     readStates.size()          = L
 *
 *     E = currentSize - previousSize + L
 *       = currentSize - previousSize + readStates.size()
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Immediately Released Reads</h2>
 * <p>A read may be confirmed and released within the same
 * {@code raft.step()} call if {@code applied >= commitIndex} at the
 * time the read enters {@code readsAwaitingApply}. Such reads appear
 * in {@code readStates} but never appear in the
 * {@code readsAwaitingApply} snapshot (they entered and exited before
 * advance). The tracker handles them by pulling directly from
 * {@code pending} during release (see {@link #releaseImmediateReads}).
 * Monotonic read indices guarantee that immediately released reads
 * always appear after previously confirmed reads in readStates, so
 * {@code releaseConfirmedReads} is called first.</p>
 *
 * <h2>FIFO Ordering Guarantee</h2>
 * <p>Correctness depends on the Raft core's monotonically
 * non-decreasing read indices. Because {@code releaseAppliedReads()}
 * drains from the front of {@code readsAwaitingApply} and stops at
 * the first entry exceeding {@code applied}, older reads are always
 * released before newer ones. This means:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>In {@code readStates}: old released reads precede new ones.</li>
 *   <li>In {@code confirmed}: old futures precede new ones.</li>
 *   <li>Popping from both in order produces correct matches.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Role Change Behavior</h2>
 * <p>On a volatile state change (role transition), only
 * {@code pending} futures are failed - these reads were never
 * confirmed and may never be. {@code confirmed} futures are
 * preserved because they represent leadership-proven reads that
 * will eventually complete when applied catches up.</p>
 *
 * <p>A notable case: a follower promoted to leader. The pending
 * futures (awaiting ReadIndexResponse from the old leader) are
 * failed because that response will never arrive. The application
 * can retry these reads against the new leader. Recovering pending
 * reads automatically would require Raft algorithm-level support:
 * the new leader would need to re-register inherited reads and
 * confirm its own authority via heartbeat majority before serving
 * them. This is not currently implemented - the retry cost is low
 * since leader elections are infrequent.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Invariants</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A future exists in exactly one location: pending, confirmed,
 *       or completed (removed from both queues).</li>
 *   <li>{@code pending.size() + confirmed.size()} equals the number
 *       of in-flight read futures not yet completed or failed.</li>
 *   <li>Read indices in the confirmed queue are monotonically
 *       non-decreasing (inherited from the Raft core).</li>
 *   <li>{@code previousAwaitingApply} is always consistent with the
 *       last observed {@code readsAwaitingApply.size()}, ensuring
 *       the delta formula produces non-negative results.</li>
 *   <li>{@code newlyConfirmedUnreleasedReads <= readsAwaitingApply.size()}
 *       - the number of reads to confirm never exceeds items
 *       available at the tail of readsAwaitingApply.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Safety Checks</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code releaseConfirmedReads}: verifies that the commit index
 *       stored in the confirmed future matches the commit index in the
 *       corresponding {@code ReadState}. A mismatch indicates a FIFO
 *       violation - throws {@code IllegalStateException}.</li>
 *   <li>{@code confirmReads}: verifies that the count of reads to
 *       confirm does not exceed {@code readsAwaitingApply} size. A
 *       violation indicates a bug in the delta formula - throws
 *       {@code IllegalStateException}.</li>
 * </ul>
