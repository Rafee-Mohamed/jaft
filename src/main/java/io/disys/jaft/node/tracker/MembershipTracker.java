/**
 * Tracks the {@link CompletableFuture} for a locally proposed
 * membership change (enter-joint or leave-joint), completing it
 * when the change is applied to the Raft algorithm.
 *
 * <h2>Why Tracking is Needed</h2>
 * <p>A membership change is not effective until it is applied to
 * the Raft algorithm (not just committed). The algorithm must
 * update its internal configuration before it can use the new
 * quorum, send messages to new peers, or trigger auto-leave-joint.
 * Completing the future on apply tells the client the change is
 * fully in effect.</p>
 *
 * <h2>State Transitions</h2>
 * <pre>
 *                submit(F)                  entry in               ApplyMembership
 *                                         entriesToApply           stepped into Raft
 *   empty -----------------> pending(F) -----------------> confirmed(F) -----------------> F.complete(null)
 *                                 |                            |                            back to empty
 *                                 | state change               | state change
 *                                 v                            v
 *                        F.completeExceptionally()       preserved (no-op)
 *                           back to empty
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>When Pending and Confirmed are Empty</h2>
 * <p>Membership entries appear in {@code entriesToApply} and
 * trigger {@code ApplyMembership}/{@code ApplyLeaveJoint} on
 * every node in the cluster, not just the node whose client
 * proposed the change. The tracker only has work to do when
 * a local client called {@code propose()} or
 * {@code proposeLeaveJoint()}. On all other nodes, both fields
 * remain empty and all methods are no-ops. Common cases:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A follower applying a membership change proposed by
 *       a different node's client.</li>
 *   <li>A leader processing a forwarded membership change
 *       that arrived via {@code receive()}, not {@code propose()}.</li>
 *   <li>Auto-leave-joint: the Raft algorithm internally proposes
 *       leave-joint after applying enter-joint. No client call
 *       was made, so no future exists.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>One-at-a-Time Invariant</h2>
 * <p>The Raft algorithm rejects a new membership change if one
 * is already pending ({@code applied < pendingConfigIndex}). This
 * guarantees that at most one future is tracked at any time.
 * {@link #submit} enforces this with an
 * {@code IllegalStateException} if called while pending is
 * already present.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Committed-but-not-Applied on State Change</h2>
 * <p>If a membership entry is committed (replicated to majority)
 * but the leader loses leadership before {@code ApplyMembership}
 * fires, the future moves to confirmed during
 * {@link #reconcile} (the entry appears in
 * {@code entriesToApply} in the same output as the state change).
 * Because {@code confirmIfCommitted} runs before
 * {@code failPendingOnStateChange}, the future is preserved in
 * confirmed and will complete when apply fires. This avoids
 * unnecessary client retries that could trigger a duplicate
 * membership change round.</p>
