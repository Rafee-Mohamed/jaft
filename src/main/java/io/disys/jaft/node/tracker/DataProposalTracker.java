/**
 * Tracks {@link CompletableFuture}s for locally proposed data entries,
 * completing them when the entry is applied to the state machine.
 *
 * <h2>Data Proposal Lifecycle</h2>
 * <p>A data proposal goes through four stages before the client
 * can consider it durable and retrieve results:</p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Proposed</b> - the entry is submitted via
 *       {@code node.propose(command)}. On a leader, Raft appends it
 *       to the log. On a follower, Raft forwards it to the leader.</li>
 *   <li><b>Committed</b> - the entry is replicated to a majority.
 *       It cannot be lost or overwritten. The entry appears in
 *       {@code committedEntriesToApply} or
 *       {@code committedEntriesAwaitingApply} in the Raft output.</li>
 *   <li><b>Applied</b> - the application processes the entry
 *       through its state machine, producing a result. The
 *       application stores the result (e.g., in a result map)
 *       and calls {@code applyTask.complete()}.</li>
 *   <li><b>Released</b> - the {@code ApplyResponse} event fires
 *       back into the event loop, advancing Raft's applied index.
 *       The tracker completes the future. The client unblocks and
 *       retrieves the result from the application's result map.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>ID-Based Tracking</h2>
 * <p>Unlike reads (FIFO queue) or membership changes (single slot),
 * data proposals use ID-based tracking via a {@code Map<ID, Future>}.
 * This is necessary because:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Multiple data proposals can be in-flight concurrently.</li>
 *   <li>Committed entries include both local proposals and entries
 *       from other nodes (forwarded proposals, remote proposals).
 *       A count-based approach cannot distinguish local entries
 *       from remote ones.</li>
 *   <li>IDs are intrinsic to the data - they survive serialization,
 *       replication, and leader changes. An entry's ID is the same
 *       on every node, regardless of how it arrived.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Two-Structure Model</h2>
 * <p>The tracker maintains a map for unconfirmed proposals and a
 * deque for confirmed (committed) proposals. A future exists in
 * exactly one location at any time: pending, confirmed, or
 * completed.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Future lifecycle (state transitions):</b></p>
 * <pre>
 *                submit(id, F)           entry committed           ApplyResponse

 *                                        committed entries
 *   not tracked -------------> pending -----------------> confirmed -------------> F.complete(null)

 *     (F3, 107)  107 > 103   -->  stop
 *
 *   confirmed deque:  [ (F3, 107) ]
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Why Committed Entries in Output</h2>
 * <p>The Raft output provides two disjoint sets of committed
 * entries:</p>
 * <pre>
 *   Log:  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
 *   Applied: 3
 *   Applying: 6  (entries 4-6 sent to application, bounded by maxApplyingEntriesSize)
 *   Committed: 10
 *
 *   committedEntriesToApply:        [4, 5, 6]       - bounded, for application to apply
 *   committedEntriesAwaitingApply:  [7, 8, 9, 10]   - the rest, for tracking only
 * </pre>
 * <p>Without {@code committedEntriesAwaitingApply}, entries 7-10
 * would remain in {@code pending} even though they are committed
 * (cannot be lost). If a state change occurs before they move into
 * {@code committedEntriesToApply}, their futures would be falsely
 * failed. The application would retry, causing duplicates.</p>
 * <p>By scanning both sets, the tracker confirms all committed
 * proposals regardless of apply backpressure.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Index Optimization</h2>
 * <p>{@code committedEntriesAwaitingApply} is a sliding window
 * that can overlap across advance cycles - the same entries
 * appear until they move into {@code committedEntriesToApply}.
 * To avoid redundant scanning, {@link #confirmNewlyCommitted}
 * uses the tail of the confirmed deque ({@code confirmed.getLast().index()})
 * as a high-water mark. Since log entries have contiguous indices,
 * the starting position is computed directly:</p>
 * <pre>
 *   startFrom = lastConfirmedIndex - entries.first().index() + 1
 * </pre>
 * <p>Only entries beyond the high-water mark are scanned. When
 * the confirmed deque is empty (all futures released), the scan
 * starts from the beginning. This is harmless because
 * {@code pending.remove(id)} returns null for already-confirmed
 * entries, and the {@code pending.isEmpty()} guard short-circuits
 * entirely when no proposals are in flight.</p>
 *
 * <h2>When Pending and Confirmed are Empty</h2>
 * <p>Committed entries contain proposals from all nodes in the
 * cluster, not just local proposals. The tracker only has futures
 * for entries proposed through this node's {@code propose()} method.
 * For all other entries, {@code pending.remove(id)} returns null
 * and no future is tracked. Common cases where both structures
 * are empty:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A follower applying data entries proposed by a different
 *       node's client directly to the leader.</li>
 *   <li>A leader applying entries that arrived via
 *       {@code receive()} (forwarded from a follower whose client
 *       is not on this node).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Role Change Behavior</h2>
 * <p>On a volatile state change (role transition), only
 * {@code pending} futures are failed - these proposals are not
 * yet committed and may be lost if the log is truncated by a
 * new leader. {@code confirmed} futures are preserved - the
 * committed entries will be applied regardless of role changes.</p>
 * <p>Ordering in {@link #reconcile} is critical: confirm runs
 * before failPending. Both can trigger in the same output (entries
 * committed and leader lost simultaneously). Confirming first
 * ensures committed proposals are preserved rather than
 * incorrectly failed.</p>
 * <p>Data proposals should be idempotent for Raft correctness.
 * A false failure (due to an uncommitted proposal being lost)
 * causes the client to retry. The state machine handles the
 * duplicate as a no-op.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Invariants</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A future exists in exactly one location: pending map,
 *       confirmed deque, or completed (removed from both).</li>
 *   <li>Entry indices in the confirmed deque are monotonically
 *       increasing (inherited from the log's index ordering).</li>
 *   <li>{@code releaseApplied} drains from the head of the deque,
 *       releasing entries in log order. The applied index advances
 *       monotonically, so {@code confirmed.peek().index() <= appliedIndex}
 *       always releases the correct prefix.</li>
 *   <li>Each {@code propose()} call produces exactly one entry
 *       (singleton list). This guarantees a 1:1 mapping between
 *       a proposal's ID and its future.</li>
 * </ul>
